Disease: Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is a complex disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast tissue. It's the most common cancer in women worldwide and can also occur in men, though much less frequently. Symptoms include a new lump or mass in the breast or armpit, thickening or swelling of part of the breast, skin irritation or dimpling, breast or nipple pain, nipple retraction (turning inward), redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin, nipple discharge other than breast milk. These symptoms can also be caused by benign conditions, and not all breast cancers cause noticeable symptoms in early stages. While breast cancer originates in breast tissue, it can affect multiple organ systems including the lymphatic system, bones, lungs, liver, brain, skin, endocrine system, and immune system if it metastasizes.

A clinical breast examination is used to diagnose breast cancer through mammography, ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and potentially a biopsy.Treatment for breast cancer is usually multimodal and may include surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic therapy. Treatment is considered successful when there is complete remission (no detectable cancer), partial remission (reduction in tumor size), disease-free survival, overall survival, improved quality of life, and minimal side effects and complications. If treatment fails, alternative chemotherapy regimens, clinical trials of new drugs or combinations, targeted therapies based on genetic profiling of the tumor, and palliative care to manage symptoms may be utilized.

Several genes have been identified as being associated with breast cancer. The most well-known and studied include:

a) BRCA1 and BRCA2: These tumor suppressor genes are the most common hereditary breast cancer genes. Expressed in many tissues, particularly during embryonic development and in adult breast and ovarian tissues. They play crucial roles in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. In breast epithelial tissue, loss of function mutations lead to decreased expression or non-functional proteins. This impairs DNA repair, causing genomic instability, which contributes to cancer development.

b) TP53: A tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell division and prevents tumor formation. Expressed in all tissues, with increased expression during cellular stress or DNA damage. Often mutated in breast epithelial cells, leading to loss of function or altered function. The mutated p53 fails to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis, allowing damaged cells to survive and proliferate.

c) PIK3CA: Often mutated in breast cancer, affecting cell growth and survival. Widely expressed in various tissues, playing a role in cell signaling and growth. Frequently mutated in breast cancer cells, leading to increased activity. Activating mutations result in increased cell survival and proliferation through the PI3K/AKT pathway.

d) PTEN: Another tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated in breast cancer. Expressed in multiple tissues, regulating cell cycle and growth. Expressed in many epithelial tissues during development, playing a role in cell growth and differentiation. Frequently downregulated or lost in breast cancer cells, leading to uncontrolled activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This promotes cell survival and proliferation, contributing to tumor growth.

e) HER2 (ERBB2): Amplification or overexpression of this gene occurs in about 20-30% of breast cancers. Expressed in many epithelial tissues during development, playing a role in cell growth and differentiation. Amplified or overexpressed in about 20-30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of HER2 leads to increased cell proliferation and survival through multiple signaling pathways.

f) ESR1 and PGR: Genes encoding estrogen and progesterone receptors, respectively.Primarily expressed in reproductive tissues, including breast, ovary, and uterus. Their expression increases during puberty and pregnancy. Altered expression of these genes, either overexpressed or underexpressed, defines different breast cancer subtypes. The misexpression affects hormone-responsive gene regulation, influencing cell growth and survival.

g) CCND1: Encodes Cyclin D1, often amplified in breast cancer. Expressed in various tissues during cell cycle progression. Often amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer cells. This promotes cell cycle progression and uncontrolled cell division, contributing to tumor growth. 

h) MYC: A proto-oncogene frequently amplified in breast cancer. Widely expressed during embryonic development and in adult tissues, regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.  Frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer cells. MYC amplification leads to increased expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and metabolism, further promoting cancer development.

i) HOX genes: Several HOX genes, including HOXA5, HOXA9, and HOXD10, have been implicated in breast cancer development. Expressed during embryonic development in specific spatial and temporal patterns, crucial for body patterning and organ development. In adult tissues, they maintain tissue-specific functions. Various HOX genes, including HOXD10, are misexpressed in breast cancer, often downregulated in breast cancer tissues. This misexpression can lead to altered cell differentiation, increased proliferation, and enhanced invasive capabilities.

Three hypotheses explaining how the misexpression of these genes leads to breast cancer:

    Hypothesis 1: Genomic Instability and DNA Repair Deficiency
The misexpression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 leads to impaired DNA repair mechanisms and genomic instability. This results in an accumulation of genetic mutations, including those in other cancer-related genes. The inability to correct these mutations allows cells to acquire additional cancer-promoting characteristics, such as uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, ultimately leading to breast cancer development.

    Hypothesis 2: Dysregulation of Cell Signaling Pathways
Misexpression of genes like PIK3CA, PTEN, and HER2 leads to hyperactivation of key signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. This dysregulation results in increased cell survival, proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. Additionally, altered expression of hormone receptors (ESR1 and PGR) disrupts normal hormone-responsive gene regulation. The combined effect of these signaling abnormalities creates a cellular environment conducive to breast cancer initiation and progression.

    Hypothesis 3: Altered Cell Cycle Control and Differentiation
Misexpression of cell cycle regulators like CCND1 and MYC, combined with altered expression of developmental regulators such as HOX genes, leads to a state of aberrant cell cycle control and impaired differentiation. This results in a population of breast epithelial cells that continue to proliferate but fail to terminally differentiate. These cells are more susceptible to additional genetic and epigenetic changes, increasing the likelihood of malignant transformation. Furthermore, the altered expression of HOX genes may contribute to the acquisition of stem cell-like properties, promoting tumor initiation and progression.
