Disease: Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is a complex disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast tissue. It's the most common cancer in women worldwide and can also occur in men, though much less frequently. Symptoms include a new lump or mass in the breast or armpit, thickening or swelling of part of the breast, skin irritation or dimpling, breast or nipple pain, nipple retraction (turning inward), redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin, nipple discharge other than breast milk. These symptoms can also be caused by benign conditions, and not all breast cancers cause noticeable symptoms in early stages. While breast cancer originates in breast tissue, it can affect multiple organ systems including the lymphatic system, bones, lungs, liver, brain, skin, endocrine system, and immune system if it metastasizes.

A clinical breast examination is used to diagnose breast cancer through mammography, ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and potentially a biopsy.Treatment for breast cancer is usually multimodal and may include surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic therapy. Treatment is considered successful when there is complete remission (no detectable cancer), partial remission (reduction in tumor size), disease-free survival, overall survival, improved quality of life, and minimal side effects and complications. If treatment fails, alternative chemotherapy regimens, clinical trials of new drugs or combinations, targeted therapies based on genetic profiling of the tumor, and palliative care to manage symptoms may be utilized.

Several genes have been identified as being associated with breast cancer. The most well-known and studied include:
a) BRCA1 and BRCA2: These tumor suppressor genes are the most common hereditary breast cancer genes 1.
b) TP53: A tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell division and prevents tumor formation 2.
c) PIK3CA: Often mutated in breast cancer, affecting cell growth and survival 3.
d) PTEN: Another tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated in breast cancer 4.
e) HER2 (ERBB2): Amplification or overexpression of this gene occurs in about 20-30% of breast cancers 5.
f) ESR1 and PGR: Genes encoding estrogen and progesterone receptors, respectively 6.
g) CCND1: Encodes Cyclin D1, often amplified in breast cancer 7.
h) MYC: A proto-oncogene frequently amplified in breast cancer 8.
i) HOX genes: Several HOX genes, including HOXA5, HOXA9, and HOXD10, have been implicated in breast cancer development 9.
