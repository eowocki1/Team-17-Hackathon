Disease: breast cancer

Breast cancer is a complex disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast tissue 1. It's the most common cancer in women worldwide and can also occur in men, though much less frequently.

Symptoms: 
A new lump or mass in the breast or armpit
Thickening or swelling of part of the breast
Skin irritation or dimpling
Breast or nipple pain
Nipple retraction (turning inward)
Redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin
Nipple discharge other than breast milk 2
It's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by benign conditions, and not all breast cancers cause noticeable symptoms in early stages.

Diagnostic Criteria: Clinical Breast Examination (CBE)

Imaging: Mammography, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

Biopsy: Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), Core Needle Biopsy, Surgical Biopsy 3
The definitive diagnosis is made through biopsy, which allows for histological examination and determination of cancer type and grade.

Prognostic Criteria:
Several factors influence the prognosis of breast cancer:
Stage of the cancer (TNM classification: Tumor size, Node involvement, Metastasis)
Grade of the tumor (how abnormal the cancer cells look and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread)
Hormone receptor status (ER, PR)
HER2 status
Age and overall health of the patient
Genomic tests (e.g., Oncotype DX, MammaPrint) 4

Frontline Treatments for Breast Cancer:
Treatment is typically multimodal and may include:
Surgery: Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy), Mastectomy
Radiation Therapy: External beam radiation, Brachytherapy
Systemic Therapies: Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancers), Targeted Therapy (e.g., Trastuzumab for HER2-positive cancers), Immunotherapy (in some cases) 5
Criteria for Successful Treatment: Complete remission (no detectable cancer), Partial remission (reduction in tumor size), Disease-free survival, Overall survival, Improved quality of life, Minimal side effects and complications
Options if Frontline Therapy Fails: Alternative chemotherapy regimens, Clinical trials of new drugs or combinations, Targeted therapies based on genetic profiling of the tumor, Palliative care to manage symptoms and improve quality of life 6

Physiology Perspective: Organs Involved in Expression of Breast Cancer:
While breast cancer originates in breast tissue, it can affect multiple organ systems:
Breast: Primary site of tumor growth
Lymphatic System: Often the first site of metastasis
Bones: Common site of metastasis
Lungs: Potential site of metastasis
Liver: Potential site of metastasis
Brain: Less common but serious site of metastasis
Skin: Can be affected in inflammatory breast cancer
Endocrine System: Affected by hormone receptor status and hormone therapies
Immune System: Plays a role in cancer surveillance and response to immunotherapies 7

It's important to note that breast cancer is not a single disease but a group of diseases with different molecular subtypes, each with its own characteristics and treatment approaches. The management of breast cancer is continually evolving with advances in molecular biology, imaging techniques, and targeted therapies.
Early detection through screening programs and advances in treatment have significantly improved outcomes for many breast cancer patients. However, challenges remain, particularly for aggressive subtypes and metastatic disease. Ongoing research focuses on developing more personalized treatment strategies based on the specific characteristics of each patient's cancer.
