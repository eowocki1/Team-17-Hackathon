Disease: Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is a complex disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast tissue. It's the most common cancer in women worldwide and can also occur in men, though much less frequently. Symptoms include a new lump or mass in the breast or armpit, thickening or swelling of part of the breast, skin irritation or dimpling, breast or nipple pain, nipple retraction (turning inward), redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin, nipple discharge other than breast milk. These symptoms can also be caused by benign conditions, and not all breast cancers cause noticeable symptoms in early stages. While breast cancer originates in breast tissue, it can affect multiple organ systems including the lymphatic system, bones, lungs, liver, brain, skin, endocrine system, and immune system if it metastasizes.

A clinical breast examination is used to diagnose breast cancer through mammography, ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and potentially a biopsy.Treatment for breast cancer is usually multimodal and may include surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic therapy. Treatment is considered successful when there is complete remission (no detectable cancer), partial remission (reduction in tumor size), disease-free survival, overall survival, improved quality of life, and minimal side effects and complications. If treatment fails, alternative chemotherapy regimens, clinical trials of new drugs or combinations, targeted therapies based on genetic profiling of the tumor, and palliative care to manage symptoms may be utilized.
